# Advent Of Code Swift Edition

This repository will contain the test projects for the Advent Of Code. Started in 2020, the previous challenge will be solved as times comes by.

My main objective is not to produce the best code ever. I don't have the pretention to be able to do so. Instead, I'm focusing on practising on the Test Driven Development and Design approach.

Forget about graphical representation of solutions and/or best performance in code execution or even one line programs. Here, you will find plain old swift test code. Sorry.

The classes that contain the algorithm to compute each answer is available in each test file. I kept it that way for the sake of simplicity.

This work does not represent my everyday skill level. I do this event just for fun. Nothing less, nothing more. So don't get too serious about it. :)
